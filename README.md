Roman Numeral Code Kata
=======================

On the Thursday, March 3, 2016, meeting of
[Lambda Lounge](http://lambdalounge.org/2016/02/29/march-an-evening-of-rust/),
there was a mob-programming session using Rust to convert numbers into
Roman numerals. The mob made some progress, but the solution was not finished,
so [Mario Aquino](https://github.com/marioaquino/) has asked others to post
their completed versions of the kata.

I have provided my own version, giving myself a chance to play around with
Rust. I've provided a solution in Scala, too, as a baseline of comparison.
Neither version currently handles subtraction notation (i.e., IV instead of
IIII).
